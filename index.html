			<img id="Johnny" src="assets/images/scrunchyface.jpg" alt="Johnny">

			<p>Welcome to my first page...EVER!  I'm excited to show you what I can do.  As my abilities evolve, over the course of my learning experience at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp, I will be updating this page to show you all of my new skills.  I'm a complete noob, so I welcome all the constructive criticism you have to offer.</p>

			<br>

			<p>My background is primarily in healthcare.  I have been a nurse for 8 years and involved with healthcare for the last 10.  I am currently a Clinical Research Nurse for division of Infectious Diseases at Northwestern Univerisity.  My work is primarily on HIV/AIDS clinical trials.  I plan to use all the fun stuff I learn during the next 6 months to help us get rid of a disease that has been affecting MY community for the last 30 plus years.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>On an even more personal level, I call myself a Chicagoan because I've spent the bulk of my life here.  I love this city and no matter how many times I've left, it always pulls me back.  I run my days pretty full between full time work, working out, community involvement, and now class.  I also like to have a little fun playing softball, rugby, and following the Chicago House music scene.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>I am excited for you to follow me on this journey as I learn a new language.  Let's push things forward!</p>
